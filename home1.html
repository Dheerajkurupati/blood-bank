<p id="p1">Blood Donation is for public donation center with blood donation members in the changing health care system.
Blood donation is an integral part of the health and well being of the community. The need is constant, and there is no 
substitute for volunteer blood donations.<br>
Every 2 seconds, someone needs a blood transfusion. And, each donation can help save up to three lives. Blood donation
 occurs when a 
person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process
 called fractionation
 (separation of whole blood components).<br> Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (apheresis).
 Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.

<h2 style="color:rgb(251, 93, 93) ;">Why Should People Donate Blood ?</h2>
<p id="p1">Safe blood saves lives. Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth,
    children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and 
    surgical and cancer patients.<br>
    There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited 
    period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is 
    needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed.<br>
    Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person - the gift of life.
    A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into
    its components - red cells, platelets and plasma - which can be used individually for patients
    with specific conditions.</p>
