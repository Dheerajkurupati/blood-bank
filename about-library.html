<h1>Blood groups</h1>
<p>There are 4 main blood groups (types of blood) - A, B, AB and O. Your blood group
     is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents.</p>
<p>Each group can be either RhD positive or RhD negative, which means in total there are 8 blood groups.</p>
<br>
<h1>Antibodies and antigens</h1>
<p>Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma.
     Your blood group is identified by antibodies and antigens in the blood.</p>
<p>Antibodies are proteins found in plasma. They're part of your body's natural defences. They recognise foreign substances,
     such as germs, and alert your immune system, which destroys them.</p>
<p>Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells.</p>
<br>
<h1>The ABO system</h1>
<p>There are 4 maReceiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening. For example, 
    if someone with group B blood is given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.
    in blood groups defined by the ABO system:</p>
    <img src="https://media.slidesgo.com/storage/14720674/conversions/18-blood-donation-infographics-thumb.jpg" >
<ul type="square">
<li><b>Blood group A </b>- has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma</li>
<li><b>Blood group B </b>- has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma</li>
<li><b>Blood group O </b>- has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma</li>
<li><b>Blood group AB </b>- has both A and B antigens, but no antibodies</li>
</ul>
<p>Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening. For example, if someone with group B blood is
     given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.</p>
<p>This is why group A blood must never be given to someone who has group B blood and vice versa.</p>
<p>As group O red blood cells do not have any A or B antigens, it can safely be given to any other group.</p>
<p>The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) website has more information about the different blood groups.</p>
<br>
<h1>The Rh system</h1>
<p>Red blood cells sometimes have another antigen, a protein known as the RhD antigen. If this is present, your blood group
     is RhD positive. If it's absent, your blood group is RhD negative.</p>
<p>This means you can be 1 of 8 blood groups:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>A RhD positive (A+)</li>
<li>A RhD negative (A-)</li>
<li>B RhD positive (B+)</li>
<li>B RhD negative (B-)</li>
<li>O RhD positive (O+)</li>
<li>O RhD negative (O-)</li>
<li>AB RhD positive (AB+)</li>
<li>AB RhD positive (AB-)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>In most cases, O RhD negative blood (O-) can safely be given to anyone. It's often used in medical emergencies
     when the blood type is not immediately known.</p>
<p>It's safe for most recipients because it does not have any A, B or RhD antigens on the surface of the cells, and 
    is compatible with every other ABO and RhD blood group.</p>
<p>The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) website has more information about the Rh system.</p>
<br>
<h1>Blood group test</h1>
<p>To work out your blood group, your red cells are mixed with different antibody solutions. If, for example,
     the solution contains anti-B antibodies and you have B antigens on your cells (you're blood group B), it 
     will clump together.</p>

<p>If the blood does not react to any of the anti-A or anti-B antibodies, it's blood group O. A series of tests
     with different types of antibody can be used to identify your blood group.</P>
<p>If you have a blood transfusion – where blood is taken from one person and given to another – your blood will
     be tested against a sample of donor cells that contain ABO and RhD antigens. If there's no reaction, donor blood
      with the same ABO and RhD type can be used.</p>
<br>
<h1>Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Pregnant women are always given a blood group test. This is because if the mother is RhD negative but the child
     has inherited RhD-positive blood from the father, it could cause complications if left untreated.</p>
<p>RhD-negative women of child-bearing age should always only receive RhD-negative blood.</p>

<br>
<h1>Giving blood</h1>
<p>Most people are able to give blood, but only 1 in 25 people actually do. You can donate blood if you:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>are fit and healthy</li>
<li>weigh at least 50kg (7st 12lb)</li>
<li>are 17-66 years old (or 70 if you've given blood before)</li>
<li>are over 70 and have given blood in the last 2 years</li>
</ul>

<p>World Blood Donor Day is celebrated every year by people around the world on June 14.
     It is celebrated on the birthday anniversary of Karl Landsteiner on June 14, 1868.[5] Landsteiner was awarded
      the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the ABO blood group system.</p>
